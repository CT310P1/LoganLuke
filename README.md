### This is where code for Project 1 will live
### A presentation of the beautiful of *Nebraska*

Edits: The code is the exact same as the demo provided in lab.

## Important!:

#### How to copy this repo to your ..../ct310 folder:
* cd to your ct310 folder and do the following commands:
* git pull origin master

#### How to copy and overwrite fuel folder in your ~username/ folder:
You'll see that there is a copy of the fuel folder in this repo. This is so that
the fuel folder gets copied into the repo. This also means that your fuel folder is
not being updated in ~username/fuel.
To fix this: 
* cd to ..../ct310
* cp -TR ./fuel ../../
This should update the fuel folder in your home dir.
